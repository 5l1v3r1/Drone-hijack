Drone-hijack
============

This Project uses a Panda board mounted on top of my drone (the attacker) to hijack other drones autonomously and fly them back to the station. The hijacking can be done autonomously. The flight control can also be done autonomously or remotely if we managed to connect to the Panda board from other network.
